# SC_StreamDeck

My collection of PNGs for use with the streamdeck and https://github.com/mhwlng/streamdeck-starcitizen

V 01 :
Pretty sure I'm just using the BEBAS font for the text. Feel free to resue or remix however you want.

V 02 :
Using the MS 33558.ttf font to make it look more flight-decky.  Also goofed around with deisgn for legibility.
